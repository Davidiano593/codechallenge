# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The following project has the purpose of using our knowledge and skills in Excel to summarize and visualize some data that will help to better understand a specific doubt or question.
Under a large series of data we were able to summarize and find the specific values of a campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the results according to the launch date we can observe that within all the categories the month in which the levels of success were highest was the month of May, while the highest level of failure was in July.
If we take only the theater as a reference, the highest level is also located in May but the lowest level of success is in December; therefore, I have determined that the best month to launch a project is the month of May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to the Results based on the goal, the largest number of projects are located in which the range of the goal is from 1,000 to 4,999 dollars, and the percentage of success is 73%.
The highest percentage of success is in projects whose goal is less than 1,000 dollars, which is why I can determine that projects with lower expectations of raising money are more likely to be successful, and that is why there are more projects in that range.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I had was trying to find the error in a formula, after analyzing it step by step and letter by letter, I was able to find the error, which is why I learned to take my time to write it properly and review it each time
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. the best time to lauch a project is during spring
2. during the month of July the projects had the highest number of failures

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that when the objective of raising money is lower, it is easier to achieve the objective and that is why many small projects were launched to buy large projects, which needed large sums of money, of those not so many were launched
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. It is a huge series of data where much of the information is difficult to find if the proper formula to find it is not known.
2. We need to know where the information is collected from in order to have an idea of how reliable the data series are.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Pie
- Bar
- Histogram
